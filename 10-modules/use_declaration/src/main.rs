Line 28 (function();) is called after leaving the block because of Rust's scoping rules for use statements:

Inside the block, you have use crate::deeply::nested::function;, which shadows the outer function() with deeply::nested::function().
When you exit the block, the local use binding goes out of scope.
Outside the block, calling function(); refers to the original fn function() defined at the top of the file.
So:

Inside the block: function() calls deeply::nested::function().
Outside the block: function() calls the top-level function().
Thatâ€™s why line 28 calls the outer function() only after leaving the block.
